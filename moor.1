.SH FILES
.TP
.B $XDG_DATA_HOME/moor/search_history
Moor will store your search history in this file. If $XDG_DATA_HOME is not set, the file will be
stored in the default XDG location, usually \fB~/.local/share/moor/search_history\fR.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.TP
.B LESSSECURE
Setting this to "1" prevents moor from opening new files or launching external programs, as required by
.B systemctl(1)\&.
In secure mode, the "v" command for opening the current file in an editor is disabled, and the search
history file is not updated.
.TP
.B MOOR
Additional options are read from this variable if it is set, just as if those same
options had been manually added to each moor invocation. Try setting it to
\fB\-\-reformat\fR to have JSON input automatically reformatted!
.TP
.B PAGER
If set to "moor", many programs will use
.B
moor
as their pager.
.TP
.B PAGER_LABEL
Other programs can set this to tell moor what name to show for stdin input.
